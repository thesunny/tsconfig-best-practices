     * There is a failure when transpiling "??" which is fixed by changing the
     * targe to "es6".
     *
     * I think this needs to be clarified though. It's possible a better fix
     * may be to switch `module` to be `es6`; however, I'm not sure if rollup
     * is expecting the output to be `ESNext` only.
     *
     * Generally, I think we need to learn the different between combinations
     * of `module` and `target` and how they affect the output.
